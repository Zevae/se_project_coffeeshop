## Plan on improving the project

Firstly, I would make the fonts on the navigation bar a little bigger in size, so that there's a nice balance between the navigation text and the color contrast of the rest of the page.

I would then personally make the hors information a blue color so that they stand out and grab the client's attention, because even though the information is perfectly spaced, I feel like the color is too close to the background image color.

On the reservation page, I would make that bright blue color abit darker so that the page isn't as bright.

As for the menupage, I would put the menu header and description in a bordered box element with a white background, so that the decription of the menu header is easier to read.

Lastly, I would make the copyright section in the footer closer to the logo. Not close enough to clash with the logo, but to make everything look more put together, because personally Idon't like the look of all of he spacing in between the logo and the copyright trademark inside the footer.
